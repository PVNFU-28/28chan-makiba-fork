running websites, this is the version to use. Alternatively if you want
a version that will never have significant changes, check out one of the
versioned branches.

MySQL/MariaDB 5.1+ (with experimental support for PostgreSQL 8+ and SQLite 3)
PHP 5.3+

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Create a blank database
2) Unzip makiba into a folder on the web host
3) Visit the folder with a web browser
4) Enter the location of the database

   not, you should be given instructions on how to fix any errors~
